# Subagents Demo Guide

This folder contains examples and demonstrations of GitHub Copilot's subagent capabilities. Subagents allow you to delegate complex, multi-step tasks to autonomous agents that can research, analyze, and execute operations independently.

## What are Subagents?

Subagents are specialized AI agents that can:
- Perform complex research across codebases
- Execute multi-step tasks autonomously
- Search and analyze code patterns
- Gather comprehensive context before making changes
- Work in the background while you continue other tasks

```

## Quick Start

1. Open [DEMO_GUIDE.md](DEMO_GUIDE.md)
2. Copy any prompt from the guide
3. Paste it into GitHub Copilot Chat
4. Watch the subagent work autonomously

## Key Benefits

✅ **Autonomous Operation**: Subagents work independently without constant supervision
✅ **Comprehensive Research**: Thoroughly searches and analyzes before acting
✅ **Complex Task Handling**: Manages multi-step workflows automatically
✅ **Context Awareness**: Gathers all necessary context before making changes
✅ **Time Efficient**: Handles tasks that would require multiple manual steps

## Use Cases

- Code refactoring across multiple files
- Security vulnerability analysis
- Performance optimization research
- Comprehensive code documentation
- Dependency impact analysis
- Architecture pattern migration
